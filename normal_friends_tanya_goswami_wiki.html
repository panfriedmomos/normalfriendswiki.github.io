    <h1>Normal Friends with Tanya Goswami</h1>

    <h2>1. Intro Paragraph</h2>
    <p><strong>Normal Friends with Tanya Goswami</strong> is a modern-day social phenomenon and a mildly exciting yet confusing companionship between Ms. or Mrs. Tanya Goswami (also known as “Tangos” from Moti Nagar, New Delhi) and Mohit Raju (popularly known as “Momos” from the cool city of Bangalore). The current relationship status of Ms./Mrs. Goswami remains undisclosed — a detail of strategic mystery to her “normal friend.”</p>
    <p>The friendship is defined by spontaneous venting sessions, unspoken agreements, occasional ghosting (frequently by the Ms./Mrs., as tradition dictates), and over-sharing (enthusiastically led by the Mr.). Despite being geographically divided across North and South India, the duo insists—loudly and confidently—that everything about their dynamic is, in fact, very normal.</p>
    <p>Society remains divided on the matter.</p>

    <h2>2. History</h2>
    <p>Content trimmed for brevity – full story includes first sightings, academic voyeurism, Parvati detours, and the quiet build-up of “normal” chaos.</p>

    <h2>3. Key Events</h2>
    <p>Includes events like: “The Keychain Slide,” “Revothsava Redemption,” “The Butt Awakening,” “Do You Hate Me? Arc,” “Accidental Delhi Meetup,” and the “No-Contact Still Friends” theory, now under sociological review.</p>

    <h2>4. Quotes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>“We are just normal friends. Like really normal. Why are you asking?” — Tanya, suspiciously</li>
        <li>“This friendship makes no sense but also makes perfect sense. That’s the magic.” — Close associate, still confused</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Controversies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Are they more than friends?</strong> “No,” said both parties, simultaneously and very defensively.</li>
        <li><strong>Did Tanya ghost you or are you ghosting Tanya?</strong> The truth may never be known.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Legacy</h2>
    <p>The “normal friends” dynamic has become a case study for introverts, overthinkers, and emotionally fluent meme sharers. Their friendship continues to inspire countless WhatsApp groups with zero messages and occasional “lol we should catch up soon.”</p>
