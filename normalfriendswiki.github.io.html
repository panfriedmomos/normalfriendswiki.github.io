  <h1>
   Normal Friends with Tanya Goswami
  </h1>
  <h2>
   1. Intro
  </h2>
  <p>
   Normal Friends with Tanya Goswami is a modern-day social phenomenon and a mildly exciting yet confusing companionship between Ms. or Mrs. Tanya Goswami (also known as “Tangos” from Moti Nagar, New Delhi) and Mohit Raju (popularly known as “Momos” from the cool city of Bangalore). The current relationship status of Ms./Mrs. Goswami remains undisclosed — a detail of strategic mystery to her “normal friend.”
  </p>
  <p>
   The friendship is defined by spontaneous venting sessions, unspoken agreements, occasional ghosting (frequently by the Ms./Mrs., as tradition dictates), and over-sharing (enthusiastically led by the Mr.). Despite being geographically divided across North and South India, the duo insists—loudly and confidently—that everything about their dynamic is, in fact, very normal.
  </p>
  <p>
   Society remains divided on the matter.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2. History
  </h2>
  <p>
   The genesis of the Tanya–Mohit friendship dates back to late 2018, when Mohit Raju, then a self-proclaimed “lighting enthusiast” (but more accurately, a wandering Bangalore boy with a suspiciously flexible schedule), made an unexpected appearance at Reva University’s School of Performing Arts. Officially, he was accompanying his friend Deepa under the noble pretext of “learning lighting design.” Unofficially, he was there to stare at women.
  </p>
  <p>
   It was during this innocent act of academic voyeurism that Mohit encountered someone who would become permanently etched into the deepest folds of his life: Ms. or Mrs. Tanya Goswami (her marital status remains undisclosed, as the two are, after all, only “normal friends”).
  </p>
  <p>
   Standing confidently at the center of a complex Kuchipudi formation and surrounded by other skilled dancers, Tanya quite literally took the spotlight—rightfully so, as she was (and reportedly still is) the best, the prettiest, and the most commanding presence in the room. Even Mohit, a chronic overthinker and full-time idiot, admits: “Wow.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Mohit’s internal monologue also reports that she had “a great butt.” This detail remains unverified by the subject in question, as Mohit—despite several years of discreet visual research and absolutely no clear, consensual photographic or in-person confirmation—has never managed to substantiate the claim. Nonetheless, general consensus within his personal recollections, and annoyingly numerous retellings continues to uphold this as a factual observation of the great butt sighting.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though no words were exchanged during this initial encounter, a seed was planted—one that would lie dormant for a few days (or possibly months, depending on memory inconsistencies) before blossoming into the scarily high-emotion rollercoaster now known as their “very normal” friendship.
  </p>
  <p>
   First Interactions
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite the life-altering impact of seeing Tanya Goswami perform on stage, Mohit Raju—true to his form as a confident observer but cowardly participant—lacked the emotional bandwidth and basic courage required to initiate a conversation with the beautiful woman he had just seen.
  </p>
  <p>
   Adding to his hesitation, his friend Deepa promptly informed him that Ms. or Mrs. Tanya Goswami (her marital status remains undisclosed, as the two are, after all, only “normal friends” and not “close friends”) was not only from Delhi, but also fully capable of delivering both verbal and physical beatdowns if approached in a romantic context. Mohit, being the emotionally fragile Bangalore boy that he was (and still is), took this advice with extreme seriousness and vowed to stay at least two emotional meters away from Tanya at all times.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an unpredictable detour, Mohit began interacting with Parvati, a mutual friend of both Deepa and Tanya. What began as harmless conversation between acquaintances quickly spiraled into a bizarrely undefined dynamic that, to this day, remains a topic of confusion, debate, and revisionist storytelling.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tanya, meanwhile, allegedly sensed this odd connection and took it upon herself to begin casually meddling—perhaps out of amusement, perhaps as a social experiment. Whether by fate or sheer nosiness, this led to Tanya making sudden and unprovoked appearances in Mohit’s conversations, campus surroundings, and eventually, his entire life. These early overlaps—though seemingly random—marked the beginning of a long chain of mildly awkward, unexpectedly intense, and consistently "normal" interactions that would define their dynamic for years to come.

   3. Key Events
  </h2>
  <p>
   Over the years, from their very first interactions at Reva University, the Tanya–Mohit “normal friendship” has been punctuated by a series of emotionally unpredictable and socially unnecessary events. While pretty much everything about these two has been unplanned, impulsive, and entirely spontaneous, each episode has nonetheless contributed significantly to the evolution of this very “normal” friendship.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fate, it seems, was feeling particularly experimental the day it decided to script this storyline.
  </p>
  <h3>
   30th November 2018 – The keychain
  </h3>
  <p>
   In what is now considered a landmark moment in the Tanya–Mohit timeline, the humble gifting of a keychain triggered a series of events that would alter the course of both their lives.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the time, Mohit was engaged in texts with Parvati, a mutual friend of both him and Tanya. Upon returning from a trip to Delhi, Parvati gifted Mohit a keychain — an act that surprised him deeply, as he is not someone who typically receives gifts (emotionally or otherwise). Overwhelmed by this generosity, Mohit proudly posted the keychain on his Instagram story.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unbeknownst to him, this singular story would be the digital portal that changed everything.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although Tanya and Mohit had been following each other on Instagram for a while, Mohit — being the antisocial loser he proudly remains — had never dared to message her. Tanya, however, spotted the story and made history:
 She slid into his DMs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Her first message read, “She didn’t get me anything dude,” referring to Parvati — her close friend and roommate — Outraged by the injustice and driven by envy, Tanya’s casual complaint instantly opened a line of communication between the two.
  </p>
  <p>
   This moment marks the verified first direct conversation between them.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a completely unnecessary and emotionally charged response, Mohit promised to gift Tanya a dance-related keychain to restore balance to their friendship economy. Like most promises made by weak men under pressure from pretty women, this one went unfulfilled for nearly seven years.
  </p>
  <p>
   It wasn’t until Tanya’s 28th birthday celebration in Udaipur on 15th July 2025 that Mohit finally delivered the long-awaited keychain — a symbolic gesture completing one of the most absurdly delayed gift redemptions in modern history.
  </p>
  <h3>
   March 2019 – Revothsava 2019
  </h3>
  <p>
   As both Tanya Goswami and Mohit Raju were part of the not-so-prestigious Reva University in Bangalore—and both dabbled heavily in performing arts—it was only natural that they were selected as student coordinators for the university’s annual cultural fest, Revothsava 2019.
  </p>
  <p>
   What began as a lighthearted group project filled with planning meetings, costume chaos, and budget confusion quickly devolved into an emotionally charged mess—particularly for Tanya.
  </p>
  <p>
   Amidst the pre-fest buzz, Tanya found herself caught in a swirl of gossip involving a fellow coordinator who, understandably, had fallen in love with her (given that she was widely regarded as the most beautiful woman on campus). The situation rapidly escalated, with whispered rumors spreading across the organizing committee and placing Tanya in a deeply uncomfortable position. Being far from home, in an unfamiliar city, and surrounded by friendships that felt increasingly dishonest, Tanya found herself alienated and emotionally drained.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mohit, meanwhile, was facing his own drama involving Deepa—a subplot that received far less attention because, frankly, Mohit didn’t care. He was simultaneously occupied with other personal events and mentally absent from most of the emotional chaos brewing at college.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, upon returning to campus the night before the festival, Mohit overheard the gossip surrounding Tanya. His immediate internal response:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Wait… that’s not the Tanya I know.”
  </p>
  <p>
   From a distance, he noticed Tanya—tired, withdrawn, visibly stressed—and something shifted. The heart that was previously used for observing pretty dancers activated its “decent human being” mode. In a surprisingly tender move, Mohit offered Tanya water, juice, and a rare sense of emotional safety. No unsolicited advice, no fake promises—just quiet reassurance.
  </p>
  <p>
   He acknowledged, with full sincerity, that most people in that situation were absolute garbage. But he promised, even as one of the lesser-quality humans himself, that he would be her garbage—honestly, consistently, and platonically.
  </p>
  <p>
   This moment marked a significant shift in their bond. What had previously been casual texting and accidental interactions became something deeper: a foundation of emotional trust laid gently over a bed of juice cartons and awkward silences.
  </p>
  <p>
   They went from being two artistic nobodies in a chaotic college fest…
 to somewhat friends.
 Currently, seven long years later, they remain what they now proudly call “just normal friends.”

   4 June 2019 – The Introduction and History of Butts
  </p>
  <p>
   As previously established in foundational moments of this friendship, one of the earliest elements to captivate Mohit Raju’s attention—second only to Tanya Goswami’s undeniable beauty—was, in fact, her butt. However, due to his decision to “just be a good friend” (which later downgraded into being “just a normal friend”), Mohit chose never to openly express his admiration. He deemed it inappropriate, creepy, and socially inadvisable.
  </p>
  <p>
   That restraint came to an end—subtly—on 4 June 2019.
  </p>
  <p>
   On this fateful day, Tanya shared a relatively dark meme on Instagram. She claimed it was humorous, insisting she had a good sense of humor. Mohit disagreed, internally classifying the meme as “depressing but concerning,” and decided to steer the conversation in a more uplifting direction.
  </p>
  <p>
   He responded with a now-iconic list of things that make life worth living, writing:
  </p>
  <p>
   “There's also, friends, food, butts, music, dance, movies, dogs, oceans, Game of Thrones, lights, drums, me, desserts, mountains, cars, games.”
  </p>
  <p>
   To this, Tanya replied:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Eww why so positive man.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Mohit, emotionally wounded but committed to the bit, asked why she was being such a negative person. Tanya claimed she was a “positive person in life,” but simply enjoyed dark memes for laughs—possibly a subtle reveal of her inner emotional climate, or just regular Delhi girl chaos.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, Mohit was feeling victorious. He had, in his mind, successfully slipped the word “butts” into the conversation under the protective veil of positivity. Tanya, however, was sharper than anticipated. After a few exchanges, she suddenly messaged:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Also… did you mention butts in your list?”
  </p>
  <p>
   Cornered but committed, Mohit attempted a strategic deflection:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Whaaaaaa”
 “Typo.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Tanya was not fooled. Instead, she referenced Friends, accusing Mohit of being like Ross and Rachel’s baby who famously reacts to “I like big butts and I cannot lie.” This only empowered Mohit, who used the moment to drop a universal truth bomb:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Can we all agree we like butts?”
  </p>
  <p>
   Tanya replied with a monkey sitting emoji, which remains, to this day, an ambiguous and emotionally charged symbol. Some believe it was disapproval. Mohit, in typical delusion, took it as a sign of acceptance and spiritual victory.
  </p>
  <p>
   From that moment forward, Mohit began shamelessly bringing up butts—generally, conceptually, and in poetic discourse. However, every time he tried to specifically bring up Tanya’s butt, he was promptly rejected, warned, or met with silence. This was especially reinforced during the time Tanya was in a committed relationship.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite repeated failures and social red cards, Mohit has continued to respectfully admire from a philosophical distance. Now that Tanya is reportedly single, he occasionally revisits the topic with hopeful optimism—but also the heavy understanding that what he’s dealing with is no ordinary asset.
  </p>
  <p>
   As he confides to himself:
  </p>
  <p>
   “It’s precious and unimaginable… If I ever saw it properly, I might just have a heart attack. Or drop dead on the spot.”
  </p>
  <p>
   To this day, The Butt Topic remains a cornerstone of this very normal friendship: recurring, rejected, romanticized, and thoroughly ridiculous.
  </p>
  <h3>
   9th june 2019: Start of Managerial duties for Mohit
  </h3>
  <p>
   Mohit, overwhelmed by Tanya’s pattern of sudden emotional unavailability and zero reply rate, sent a message containing the iconic line:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Do you hate me or is this just how you are with everyone?”
  </p>
  <p>
   Tanya replied three days later with:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Haha no I just forget to exist sometimes.”
  </p>
  <p>
   This moment is now widely regarded as the beginning of their Emotionally Roasted Winter Phase.
  </p>
  <h3>
   June 2023 – Accidental Reunion in Delhi
  </h3>
  <p>
   Mohit happened to be in Delhi. Tanya “happened” to be free. They met for what was supposed to be a 20-minute catch-up. It lasted three hours. They talked about everything and nothing. No photos were taken. No one else believes it actually happened.
 It was perfect.
  </p>
  <h3>
   January 2024 – The “No Contact But Still Friends” Phase
  </h3>
  <p>
   Following months of no communication, both parties independently decided they were “definitely still friends.” Despite a total absence of calls, texts, or emojis, each was confident the friendship was intact. This phenomenon is now studied by behavioral scientists under the category of “Delusional Platonic Bonding.”
